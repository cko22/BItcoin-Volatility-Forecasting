# BItcoin-Volatility-Forecasting

### Task
One of the hurdles of investing in cryptocurrencies is the high volatility of the asset class. There have been some research efforts done to model the volatility behaviour of the biggest asset - Bitcoin.

We would like you to review the current research results, comment on them, and propose a model that would be suitable for us to incorporate into our asset allocation model? If you have a better model than the researched ones, feel free to propose your recommendation (and code) as well.

### Introduction
With the popularity of new asset class - cryptocurrencies growing in recent years, there is no reason to not include them as diversifiers for asset allocations. In this task, we focus on the most popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin. Bitcoin is highly volatile. The estimation of Bitcoin's realised volatitility suggest it is around 3x as volatite as equity. From an asset allocation point's of view, being able to accurately forecast its volatility is absolute essential for hitting the volatility targets of a portfolio.

In this task, we reviewed some papers, implemented some models in Python and commented on their suitability for Bitcoin's volatility forecasting.
